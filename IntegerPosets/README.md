# Integer Posets

[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VivianePons/public-notebooks/master?filepath=IntegerPosets)


You will find here some raw research code and a demo related to the following papers:

[1] G. Chatel, V. Pilaud, and V. Pons. [The weak order on integer posets.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07995) 2017+. 

[2] V. Pilaud and V. Pons. [The Hopf algebra of integer binary relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03277) 2018+.

They present examples and implementations of the computations and algorithms described in the papers. You can run them yourself and experiment by [clicking on this binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VivianePons/public-notebooks/master?filepath=IntegerPosets). (Expect to wait a few minutes for the server to load).
