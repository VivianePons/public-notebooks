[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VivianePons/public-notebooks/master?filepath=TamariIntervalPosets)


The notebooks here are related to the following papers:

[1] Grégory Châtel and Viviane Pons. [Counting smaller elements in the Tamari and m-Tamari lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3922), Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, 134():58 – 97, 2015. 

[2] Viviane Pons. The Rise-Contact involution on Tamari Intervals.

They present examples and implementations of the computations and algorithms described in the papers. You can run them yourself and experiment by [clicking on this binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VivianePons/public-notebooks/master?filepath=TamariIntervalPosets). (Expect to wait a few minutes for the server to load).
